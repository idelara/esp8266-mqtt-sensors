# ESP8266 - MQTT Sensor Sketches

This repo provides you with a collection of sketches that pair an ESP8266 board with
some of the most common Arduino sensors out there. The sketches are setup in a
way that after a little bit of configuration on your end, you will be able to start
pushing messages to an MQTT server in no time.

## About the repo

As of now, the examples use Nick O'Leary's [PubSubClient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient)
library to establish a connection to the MQTT Server.


## Sketches

Please refer to the `examples` folder in order to see what sketches are
currently available for your to use.
